      <h2>Hi, I'm Nassar</h2>
      <p>With over 15 years of experience as a Business Intelligence (BI) Consultant, I have built a strong track record of delivering data-driven solutions across diverse domains, 	including Finance, IT Infrastructure, Healthcare, and enterprise operations. My expertise spans the full BI lifecycle— from data modeling and ETL development to dashboard design, 	analytics automation, and cloud-based BI implementations.

	I bring deep technical proficiency in databases, Python, Power BI, and modern cloud ecosystems, enabling organizations to transform raw data into meaningful insights that drive 	decision-making. My hands-on experience includes developing scalable data models, building interactive and executive-level dashboards, creating analytical workflows, and optimizing 	performance for large-scale datasets.

	I am a certified Project Management Professional (PMP) and hold Microsoft Azure certifications, which strengthen my ability to manage complex BI projects, collaborate with cross-	functional teams, and deploy secure, high-performance analytics solutions in the cloud.

	Driven by a commitment to quality and continuous improvement, I combine technical expertise with strategic thinking to help businesses harness the full value of their data.</p>
